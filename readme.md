# THREE.JS starter repository

This repository is here to store and serve as a memo-book to myself in my adventure of teaching myself three.JS



### On this repo, you'll see :

- My progression
- The code that i'm playing with at the time
- A note.md file where I store things like function names, objects names, and important code blocks to remember



### Your turn

This repository is public, that's for a good reason.

You can fork, use, re-use all this code for yourself. You can use my notes to practice and learn THREE.JS with me.
